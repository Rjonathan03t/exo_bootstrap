                        We believe ideas come from everyone, everywhere.
                        In fact, at BlackTie, everyone within our agency walls is a designer in their own right.
                        And there are a few principles we believe—and we believe everyone should believe—about our
                        design
                        craft.
                        These truths drive us, motivate us, and ultimately help us redefine the power of design.
                        We're big believers in doing right by our neighbors.
                        After all, we grew up in the Twin Cities and we believe this place has much to offer.
                        So we do what we can to support the community we love.

                        Over the past four years, we've provided more than $1 million in combined cash and pro bono
                        support
                        to Way to Grow,
                        an early childhood education and nonprofit organization.
                        Other community giving involvement throughout our agency history includes pro bono work for more
                        than 13 organizations,
                        direct giving, a scholarship program through the Minneapolis College of Art & Design, board
                        memberships,
                        and ongoing participation in the Keystone Club,

                Employees and consumers. Two halves of a brand's entirety, the whole of a brand's audience.
                Sometimes these two halves have very different viewpoints,
                creating a weak spot in the brand story. Weakness tarnishes credibility. Brands that aren't credible
                aren't viable.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="text-muted descsct3 fw-lighter">
                We squash weakness by designing the whole brand story.
                It's crafted around the truism held by employees and consumers to create an experience that connects
                from the inside out.

            <h5 class="text-muted descsct3 fw-lighter">
                By being true to the brand we represent, we elevate the audiences' relationship to it.
                Like becomes love becomes a passion. Passion becomes advocacy.
                And we see the brand blossom from within, creating a whole story the audience embraces.
                That's when the brand can truly flex its muscles.
